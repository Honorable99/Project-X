This data isn’t just for football fans — it’s for club managers, sponsors, scouts, and performance analysts. Understanding:

 •	Wage distribution vs. contribution

 •	How different players and clubs manage value for money
	
 •	Which stats correlate with actual on-pitch success



❌ What Went Wrong? Key Discoveries

 •	Huge wage disparities across similar roles
	
 •	Top-earning players not always matching up to performance
	
 •	Specific clubs relying heavily on a few performers
	
 •	Overuse of certain players while others underutilized

 •	Some high-touch players (Kudus, Doku) lacked conversion efficiency



✅ What To Do? Recommendations

 1.	Reassess Wage Structures
	
 •	Tie future contracts more closely to performance metrics (e.g. xG, assists, defensive contributions)


 2.	Optimize Rotations
	
 •	Spread minutes to avoid burnout of core players — especially those with high defensive and midfield touches


 3.	Use Data for Recruitment
	
 •	Go beyond flashy names; look for underpaid players with high effectiveness (value-per-touch or xG/Salary ratio)


 4.	Enhance Tactical Balance
	
 •	If one player carries attacking metrics (like Salah), create strategic support around them to diversify risk
 

### 2. Exploring Arsenal FC Through Data: A 2017 - 2023 Analysis

🔴⚪ Exploring Arsenal FC Through Data (2017–2023)

A Passion Project Powered by Power BI & Football Intelligence

As a data analyst and a devoted Arsenal fan, this project was a dream come true — merging the worlds of football and analytics into one insightful journey. 

I analyzed Arsenal FC’s performance across six seasons (2017–2023), using Power BI for visual storytelling and Power Query Editor for cleaning and transforming raw data into structured insights.

The analysis explored key performance indicators (KPIs) and player metrics that uncovered both individual brilliance and broader team dynamics.



⚙ Tools & Techniques Applied

This project required me to extract meaning from messy football data using tools like Power BI for dashboarding, Power Query for preprocessing, and DAX for calculated columns and custom measures. 

I leaned into my football knowledge to interpret the numbers not just statistically, but tactically.



📈 Key Performance Highlights


Over the six-year period, Arsenal’s goalkeepers made a total of 813 saves, with seven different goalkeepers taking charge between the posts. 

This pointed to notable changes in the club’s defensive line and perhaps inconsistencies due to form, injuries, or managerial preference.

The club saw five different coaches in those years, a signal of transition and instability until Mikel Arteta’s longer-term vision began to take hold. 

A total of 51 players were analyzed — ranging from academy graduates to marquee signings — each contributing differently to the club’s story.



🔍 Standout Player Contributions


From a performance angle, Granit Xhaka stood out as the player with the most minutes played — a testament to his consistency and role under multiple managers. 

Bernd Leno recorded the most saves across the seasons, highlighting his impact during key transitional years.

In attacking metrics, Bukayo Saka led in Expected Assists (xA), proving his growth from youth prospect to creative engine. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang led in Expected Goals (xG), reflecting his peak years as Arsenal’s primary scoring threat. 

Interestingly, Granit Xhaka also had the most tackles, showing his all-round presence in midfield — both defensively and positionally.



💼 Business Analysis Layer: The McKinsey Framework Approach

Why is this important?

This kind of sports intelligence matters to coaching staff, technical directors, and recruitment teams. 

Understanding long-term performance patterns, player value, and areas of over-dependence can shape better decision-making.

What went wrong?
There was high turnover in goalkeepers and managers, revealing instability at the core of the team. 

Certain players shouldered too much of the tactical load (e.g. Xhaka and Saka), potentially increasing burnout risk. 

The team’s overall trajectory needed clearer leadership and smarter squad depth planning.

What should be done?
If I were advising the club as a football data analyst, I’d recommend strategic investments to reduce pressure on key players, deeper squad rotation to sustain performance, and long-term support for the current coaching system to build continuity. 

Leveraging xA and xG trends could also help refine recruitment strategies in line with Arsenal’s dynamic, possession-based style.


### 3. Inside Turkey Real Estate Goldmine

🏡 ₺5 Billion and Rising: Mugla Tops Turkey’s Real Estate Market in 2025
What the Data Says About the Future of Property in Turkey


As a Business Analyst with a keen eye for real estate dynamics, I recently completed a data project focused on Turkey’s 2025 property listings — and what I uncovered was nothing short of a goldmine.

Using Power BI, I cleaned, modeled, and visualized listings from 23 cities and 193 districts — categorizing by seller type (individual vs. agency), location, listing activity, and square meter values.

And then Mugla happened. 💥



📈 Dashboard Highlights & Insights


• Seller Types Tracked: Individuals and Real Estate Agencies

• Cities Covered: 23

• Districts Analyzed: 193

• Largest Property Listing (sqm): 951.00

• Peak Market Date: May 24, 2025

• Top Performer: Mugla, recording over ₺5 billion in property listings alone




💡 Business Analysis (McKinsey Framework)


Why is this important?

This project provides real-time insight into market momentum, allowing investors and policymakers to make better location-specific decisions. 

Mugla’s surge reveals a broader shift — coastal and tourism-driven cities are becoming the new real estate power hubs.

What went wrong? (Discovered)

Some major districts showed price stagnation despite high listing volume, indicating oversupply or poor valuation. 

In addition, smaller cities lacked agency representation, showing a gap in professional listings that could hinder external investment confidence.

What to do? / Recommendation
Agencies should deepen market penetration in emerging districts while optimizing pricing strategies based on demand clusters. 

For investors, it’s time to act fast in Mugla — before the ₺5B turns to ₺10B. Urban planners should consider infrastructure investments in surrounding areas to absorb spillover demand.



### 4. Tesla Sales & Customer Dashboard (2012 - 2024)

🚘🔍 Tesla 2012–2024: Customer Insights, Sales Trends & Strategic Signals from the Dashboard

As a Business Analyst and Data Storyteller, I recently completed an end-to-end analysis of Tesla’s customer and sales data from 2012 to 2024 — transforming raw vehicle, pricing, and customer data into visual insights using Power BI.


The goal? Understand how Tesla’s product performance, pricing dynamics, and customer preferences evolved over time — and what that means for business strategy in the EV sector.



📊 Key KPIs Tracked:


• Average Price (Per Year): $156.37M

• Total Driving Range Covered: 2 Million Kilometers

• Tesla Models Analyzed: 6

• Vehicle Colors: 6

• Regions Assessed: 5



🔍  Analysis Insights 


🧠 Why This Matters:


Tesla’s expansion across global regions and its growing model lineup offer a perfect lens into how consumer behavior aligns with pricing, performance, and geography. 

These insights support smarter inventory planning, targeted marketing, and model release strategies.


🔎 What We Discovered:

 •	Top-Performing Model: Tesla Semi had the highest average price — around $78,000 — showing strong commercial interest in EV trucking.
	
 •	Quarterly Trends: Q1 leads with the highest average price (₦60M+), likely tied to product launches or regional promotions.
	
 •	Peak Year: 2013 recorded the highest annual average price, indicating early market appetite post-launch.


🎨 Customer Preferences (Ratings):

 •	By Color: Silver received the highest average customer rating (4.27) — outpacing Black, Red, Green, and Blue.
	
 •	By Region: Europe recorded the highest satisfaction score at 4.25, signaling strong brand reception and product-market fit.




💡 Recommendations (What to Do):


✔ Prioritize Silver Models in high-volume regions like Europe for customer satisfaction gains.

### 5.  What Happens When Real Estate Meets Data?


💡 What Happens When Real Estate Meets Data?
Turning Raw Listings into Strategic Insights with Power BI

As a Business Intelligence Analyst, I recently completed a real estate sales analysis project that transformed a chaotic dataset into a strategic decision-making tool.

It all started with a messy spreadsheet: hundreds of rows of property listings, towns, sales figures, and years. 

At first glance, it looked like noise. 

But I saw potential. Using Power BI, I cleaned, modeled, and visualized the data to uncover powerful insights that investors, agents, and real estate developers could act on.




🎯 Business Question:


Where, what, and when are people buying the most?
This simple question opened the door to deeper business discovery.




📊 Insights Uncovered:


🔹 Total Revenue Generated – a full snapshot of sales volume across years

🔹 Listing Distribution by Town – identifying which locations had the highest activity

🔹 Property Type Preferences – residential vs. commercial, detached vs. flats

🔹 Peak vs. Low Listing Years – detecting industry slumps and booms

🔹 Sales Trends Over Time – seasonality and growth trajectories

🔹 Top-Performing Towns – based on cumulative and average sales



💡 What Stood Out:


One of the most telling visuals was the Sales Ratio by Property Type, which uncovered clear buyer preferences. These insights can guide:

✔ Marketing Strategy – tailoring ads to in-demand properties

✔ Pricing Decisions – based on location & season

✔ Investment Focus – steering capital to high-growth towns



🧠 Why It Matters:

This project wasn’t just about visuals — it was about clarity. 

It proved that data storytelling can make complex real estate trends easy to digest and act upon.

From a raw, unstructured dataset came an interactive, insight-rich dashboard — ready to support smarter decisions across the real estate value chain.
